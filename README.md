# dct_image_lab
#This lab is using DCT to perform steganography  
#First, run : labtainer dct-lab  
#this lab have 1 container, in this container
#Now, run checkwork to see how to pass the lab  
#You need to pass 3 checkwork  
#In checkwork 1, you need to prepare a jpg picture and using code to convert to binary file suitable for DCT algorithm and save as "input.jpg"  
#Compile code as "run-me". run : ./run-me
#if the code convert successful, it will print "YES" and save the output as "output.bin"  
#In checkwork 2, you need to create a secret message and save to "mess.txt"  
#Using code to hide message from "mess.txt" to "output.bin" and save the new output as "stego_output.bin"  
#If the code run successful, it will print "YES" and check the checkwork
#In checkwork 3, send the output lastest by run: ls, you will see a program name "send.c". Compile and run it, if the submission is successful, you are done.
